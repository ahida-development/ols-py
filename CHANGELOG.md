## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2024-06-04
### Changed
- Added `page` and `size` params to `get_term_parents`, `get_term_children`, and other methods
  for accessing term relatives

## [1.0.0] - 2023-12-11
### Changed
- 1.0 release!

## [0.9.9] - 2023-12-11
### Changed
- Updated to use OLS4 everywhere - OLS4 is the only version
  being actively updated now

### Removed
- `OlsClient`. This package will only support OLS4, going forward

## [0.6.1] - 2023-10-13
### Changed
- Improvements to docs only

## [0.6.0] - 2023-10-13
### Changed
- Unified OLS3 and OLS4 schemas - OLS4 is more in sync with OLS3 now, so separate schemas are no longer needed
- `mypy` is now happy with our types thanks to the unified schemas! We can keep the code type-checked from now on
- Implemented more endpoints, e.g. retrieving individuals and properties
- Reworked function arguments - any optional parameters for requests are now
specified with `TypedDict`, rather than a PyDantic object - this is more user-friendly

## [0.5.1] - 2023-09-14
### Changed
- Added types/schemas for `obo_synonym` and `obo_xref` on Term responses

## [0.5.0] - 2023-07-27
### Changed
- Updated to [Pydantic V2](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/): the new version has useful features such as multiple aliases for fields
- In Pydantic V2, url fields are stored as a URL class and cannot be directly used as strings - use `str(model.url_field)` to use them as string.

### Fixed
- Updated some schema fields to reflect latest changes to OLS4 - still a bit of a moving target!

## [0.3.0] - 2023-06-05
### Added
- Experimental support for [OLS4](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4) instances (using the current
  API). OLS4 should support the same API, but currently a few responses seem
  to have a different structure, so start implementing and testing against it.

  To use the OLS4 instance, import `Ols4Client` from `ols_py.ols4_client`

## [0.2.7] - 2023-05-25
### Changed
- Allow arbitrary annotations in search queryFields

## [0.2.6] - 2023-05-17
### Added
- `get_term_hierarchical_parents()` method

## [0.2.5] - 2022-11-23
### Added
- `OlsClient.get_terms()` endpoint for multiple terms/lookup by OBO ID
- `instances` module with URLs for known instances

## [0.2.4] - 2022-11-07
### Changed

## [0.2.0] - 2022-10-05
### Changed
- Refactored schemas to better separate schemas used in requests from schemas for responses

## [0.1.5] - 2022-09-27
### Added
- `OlsClient.get_term_in_defining_ontology()` method for looking up a term by IRI/ID alone
- Improvements to tests

## [0.1.4] - 2022-09-26
### Changed
- Add more fields to `Term` schema

## [0.1.3] - 2022-09-23
### Changed
- `OlsClient` is now exported so you can do `from ols_py import OlsClient`
- `id` is not required in `SearchResultItem`, update schema

## [0.1.2] - 2022-09-23

## [0.1.1] - 2022-09-21
